# label-noise-logreg-perceptron.ipynb
This project quantifies how increasing levels of label noise affect the performance of Logistic Regression and Perceptron classifiers. Using a synthetic 2-class dataset, we add controlled label noise (0–50% / 0–100%), train models with 10-fold cross-validation, and visualize accuracy degradation as noise increases.
